Generated multi linguals docs (geneddocs) are stored 
here and added to the db.

The format of a doc name is a main name, say `foo`, followed by '.' separated by 2 letter languages names (langnms). The first langnm is the original document, the other are translations.
`foo.blurb.md` is an optional blurb, which will contain a blurb and metatadata
about the origin of the documents which were used to generate a given geneddoc. 


Lang 2 letters names are according to [ISO 639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes)

 `foo.ru.en`
 `foo.blurb.md`

 Probably added conventions will be added to determined what docs are displayed
 and in which order.
 So far we want to seed the system with a few docs to seed the system.
 Also to nail down the format which is ad hoc (following stuff generated by grok)
