# Update Keybindings Markdown Prompt

Go through my keybindings.json and extract all custom keybindings. For each keybinding, include:
- The key combination
- The command name
- A short description of what it does (if possible, infer from the command name)

Group the keybindings by category (such as Editor Navigation, File & Window Management, Terminal Management, Formatting & Refactoring, Bookmarks, Extensions & Shortcuts, Live Server, Testing, Type & Definition Navigation, Copilot & AI, Miscellaneous).

For related actions (e.g., left/right, up/down, next/previous), group them on a single line using the format:
- **key1/key2** â€” `command1` / `command2`: Description for both actions.

Update my ~/keybindings.md file so it always reflects the current state of my keybindings.json, adding new keybindings, removing deleted ones, and regrouping as needed.
